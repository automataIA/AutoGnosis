Note that some of these parameters are explained in details in other sections of this documentation.

      <description>The Relearn theme has been built to be as configurable as possible by defining multiple partials
In themes/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/partials/, you will find all the partials defined for this theme. If you need to overwrite something, don&amp;rsquo;t change the code directly. Instead follow this page. You&amp;rsquo;d create a new partial in the layouts/partials folder of your local project. This partial will have the priority.
This theme defines the following partials :
header.html: the header of the page.</description>
